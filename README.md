# Robot-moving-using-Trust-region-policy-optimization-compared-to-proximal-policy-optimization



TRPO and PPO are algorithms used to optimize control policies in reinforcement learning.

TRPO uses a trust region method to ensure conservative updates, while PPO uses proximal optimization and a clip objective for improved sample efficiency. 

Both methods utilize the trust region method to increase reliability in finding the optimal policy for a robot's movement.
