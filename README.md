# Robot-moving-using-Trust-region-policy-optimization-compared-to-proximal-policy-optimization


TRPO and PPO are algorithms used to optimize control policies in reinforcement learning. TRPO uses a trust region method to ensure conservative updates, while PPO uses proximal optimization and a clip objective for improved sample efficiency.   Both methods utilize the trust region method to increase reliability in finding the optimal policy for a robot's movement.

1   Initialize a new notebook in the Colab platform (or use a PC system with GPU) 

2   Install necessary libraries:
-gym
-pytorch
-visualization tools
-brax library (for environments)

3   Follow the file of implementation guide in the main repository files and follow the instructions carefully.
